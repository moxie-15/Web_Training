🌐 Website Training – About Me (Moxie-15)

This repository contains my introductory website training projects, where I practiced HTML and CSS fundamentals by building simple web pages. The main highlight is my “About Me” website, a personal profile page that introduces who I am and what I do.

🚀 What I Learned

✅ HTML Basics – headings, paragraphs, links, lists, images, and structure

✅ CSS Styling – colors, fonts, layouts, borders, and backgrounds

✅ Page Structure – using <header>, <main>, <footer> sections

✅ Profile Page Design – creating a personal About Me page with bio and details

✅ How to organize a project and apply styles to improve presentationWebsite-Training/
